### Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for CryptoCurrency Prediction
This repository presents various machine learning models utilized in the finance industry for predicting stock prices and cryptocurrencies. 

- Conducting fundamental analysis of stock prices using Yahoo Finance
- Employing Seaborn for data visualization
- Utilizing ARIMA model to capture trends, seasonality, and forecast prices as a baseline
- Implementing simpler machine learning models such as Random Forest and Regression
- Applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)

Each model is compared to highlight their respective advantages and disadvantages. 

### Code
